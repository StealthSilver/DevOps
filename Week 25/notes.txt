PROCESS MANAGEMENET (PM2)

it keeps a process running unless stopped explicitely

features

- create an EC2 instance
- install node in vm  
- install npm in vm

- lsof command in ubuntu gives whatever process are running on all ports
- to get the process running on port 3000 
do lsof -i :3000
- to kill the running process run [kill processid]
