DOCKER 

docker is used for thee reasons :
1. Kubernetes / Container orchestration
2. Running processes in isolated enviornments 
3. Starting projects/ auxilary serices

containers are a way to package and distribute software applications which makes it easy to deploy consistently across different OS

1. install docker 
2. in the terminal write docker -> if runs docker is installed 

DOCKER ARCHITECTURE 

Docker CLI -> Docker Engine -> OS Kernel -> Containers
Docker Engine <-> Docker Registry (for pulling/pushing images)

1. Docker Architecture

Docker uses a client-server architecture. It allows you to package applications and dependencies into containers that can run anywhere. The main components of Docker architecture are:

Components:

Docker Client (CLI)
The interface through which users interact with Docker.
You run commands like docker run, docker build, docker push, etc.
The CLI communicates with the Docker Engine via a REST API.
Docker Engine (Server/Daemon)
The core of Docker, responsible for building, running, and managing containers.
Runs as a background process (dockerd) on your host system.
Manages images, containers, networks, and volumes.

Docker Registry
A repository to store Docker images.
Example: Docker Hub (public) or private registries.
Images are pulled from or pushed to registries.

Docker Objects
Images: Read-only templates to create containers.
Containers: Running instances of images.
Volumes: For persistent storage.
Networks: For communication between containers.

2. Docker Engine

The Docker Engine is the heart of Docker. It’s responsible for:
Building images: Using Dockerfile instructions to create container images.
Running containers: Launching isolated environments using images.
Managing containers: Start, stop, remove, and monitor containers.
Networking: Manage communication between containers.
Storage: Manage persistent data using volumes.
Components of Docker Engine:
Docker Daemon (dockerd)
Listens for Docker API requests from the CLI or other tools.
Manages images, containers, networks, and storage.
REST API
The interface for communication between the CLI and daemon.
Container Runtime
Runs containers using OS-level virtualization (cgroups, namespaces).
By default, Docker uses runc as its runtime.

3. Docker CLI

Docker Command Line Interface is how users interact with Docker.
Commands are sent to the Docker Engine, which executes them.

Examples:
docker build → Builds an image from a Dockerfile
docker run → Runs a container from an image
docker ps → Lists running containers
docker pull / docker push → Pulls or pushes images to registry
How it works:
User types a command in CLI.
CLI sends a REST API request to Docker Engine.
Docker Engine executes the request and returns the result.

4. Docker Registry

Docker Registry is a storage and distribution system for Docker images.
Public Registry: Docker Hub
Private Registry: Hosted on private servers for internal use

Workflow:

Push an image:
docker push myregistry/myimage:tag → sends image to registry
Pull an image:
docker pull myregistry/myimage:tag → downloads image from registry
Versioning:
Each image can have multiple tags, representing versions.
