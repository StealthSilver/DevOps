VERTICAL SCALING 
increasing the size of the machine for serving more users

a thread is a phenomemon that runs on the core
single threaded languages are bad for scaling. JS is a single threaded language

vertical scaling in a nodeJS process is not optimum

Rust, Go, Java are multithreaded

Implementing vertical scaling in Nodejs

we have to use cluster module in js 

CAPACITY ESTIMATION 

this is the system design question where we are asked: 
1. how will you scale your server 
2. how will you handle spikes 
3. how can you support a certain SLA (service level agreement) given some traffic 

AUTOSCALING GROUPS

we can scale servers without autoscaling groups also.
we just need a load balancer and start multiple machines.

autoscaling groups make the task easier
