LocalHost

Localhost refers to the computer you're currently working on.
It's essentially a loopback address that points to the machine itself,
allowing it to communicate with itself over a network. 

ping localhost -> to get the ip of the machine

Local network, routing(mild hosting)

If you have multiple laptops on the same wifi router, you can access one machine from another by using their private IP address.
This is a mild version of deploying your app on your local network (or whats called the intranet)

create an express server 

ifconfig this will give you all the network addresses on the machine

npx serve also serves the files on the private IP

override the domain name resolves to by obberriding the hosts file 

vi /etc/hosts 
127.0.0.1 : facebook.com

Deploying apps 

1. renting servers on cloud (AWS, Azure, GCD)
2. renting your cloud centers
3. Self Hosting (buying a CPU rack in house)
4. Serverless providers 
5. Cloud native options(k8s)

Virtual Machines 

VMs run on a physical server (called the host) but are abstracted through a layer of virtualization software called a hypervisor (e.g., VMware, KVM).
This hypervisor divides the host machineâ€™s resources (CPU, memory, storage) into separate virtual machines.

Each VM acts like a completely independent machine, even though they share the underlying hardware.
You can run different operating systems and applications in different VMs on the same physical server.

bitcoin mining will not run optimally on a virtual machine it either runs on a server in house or on a bare metal machine
