LocalHost

Localhost refers to the computer you're currently working on.
It's essentially a loopback address that points to the machine itself,
allowing it to communicate with itself over a network. 

ping localhost -> to get the ip of the machine 
ping google.com -> to get the ip of the edomain

IPv4 : 132.11.11.133 
IPv6 : [2620:1ec:33::10]:443 

Local network, routing(mild hosting)

If you have multiple laptops on the same wifi router, you can access one machine from another by using their private IP address.
This is a mild version of deploying your app on your local network (or whats called the intranet)

create an express server 

ifconfig this will give you all the network addresses on the machine

npx serve also serves the files on the private IP
