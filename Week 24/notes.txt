LocalHost

Localhost refers to the computer you're currently working on.
It's essentially a loopback address that points to the machine itself,
allowing it to communicate with itself over a network. 

ping localhost -> to get the ip of the machine 
ping google.com -> to get the ip of the edomain

IPv4 : 132.11.11.133 
IPv6 : [2620:1ec:33::10]:443 

Local network, routing(mild hosting)

If you have multiple laptops on the same wifi router, you can access one machine from another by using their private IP address.
This is a mild version of deploying your app on your local network (or whats called the intranet)

create an express server 

ifconfig this will give you all the network addresses on the machine

npx serve also serves the files on the private IP

override the domain name resolves to by obberriding the hosts file 

vi /etc/hosts 
127.0.0.1 : facebook.com

go to facebook.com:3000 and you can get some credentials

DNS propogation

Deploying apps 

1. renting servers on cloud (AWS, Azure, GCD)
2. renting your cloud centers
3. Self Hosting (buying a CPU rack in house)
4. Serverless providers 
5. Cloud native options(k8s)

Virtual Machines 

VMs run on a physical server (called the host) but are abstracted through a layer of virtualization software called a hypervisor (e.g., VMware, KVM).
This hypervisor divides the host machine’s resources (CPU, memory, storage) into separate virtual machines.

Each VM acts like a completely independent machine, even though they share the underlying hardware.
You can run different operating systems and applications in different VMs on the same physical server.

bitcoin mining will not run optimally on a virtual machine it either runs on a server in house or on a bare metal servers

In a bare-metal setup, an operating system (OS) runs directly on the physical hardware without a hypervisor in between. There’s no virtualization layer.

Since there's no hypervisor, bare-metal systems tend to offer better performance, as the OS can directly access all the server’s resources without sharing them with other instances.
This is especially important for high-performance applications like large databases, gaming servers, or mining crypto
